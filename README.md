## What I learned - 
- Learned Redux: 
  Redux is a state management library for JavaScript. It helps in keeping track of the state of the application in a centralized way. This   can be helpful for large applications with complex state.

- Learned Fetch API : 
    This is  used to get data from a server, such as the questions and answers for the quiz app.

- Learned how React actually works : 
  React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is based on the concept of components, which are small, reusable pieces of   code. This can make it easier to build complex user interfaces.

## Future Scope/ Features that can be added

- Top Performers List 
- Users Profile
